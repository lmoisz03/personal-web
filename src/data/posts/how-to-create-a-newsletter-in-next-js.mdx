Newsletters are a powerful tool for staying connected with your audience and driving engagement. In this tutorial, we will explore how to create a newsletter feature in your Next.js application. By implementing a newsletter system, you can effectively communicate with your users, share updates, and promote your products or services.

## Why Have a Newsletter?

A newsletter allows you to:

- Build a loyal audience by keeping them informed about your latest content or offerings.
- Increase website traffic and conversions through targeted email campaigns.
- Establish yourself as an authority in your industry by sharing valuable insights and expertise.
- Nurture customer relationships and encourage repeat business.

## Setting Up Mailchimp

To build our newsletter subscription system, we will utilize [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/), a popular email marketing service. Let's walk through the steps to get started:

- **Sign up for Mailchimp**: Begin by [creating an account](https://mailchimp.com/help/create-an-account/) on Mailchimp's website. Once registered, you will obtain access to various features and tools to manage your email campaigns. Additionally, you will receive an essential component called the API key.

- **Create Your Mailchimp Audience**: In Mailchimp, an audience represents your subscriber list. Create an audience tailored to your specific needs, whether it's for a blog, business, or organization. This audience will serve as the recipient base for your newsletters and updates. Make sure to note down the [audience ID](https://mailchimp.com/help/find-audience-id/), which uniquely identifies your created audience.

- **Fetch Your Server Prefix**: Mailchimp operates on different server clusters, each identified by a [server prefix](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/guides/quick-start/#make-your-first-api-call). To make API calls to Mailchimp, you need to determine the server prefix associated with your account. This prefix is typically a combination of letters and numbers, such as "us17." Refer to Mailchimp's documentation for guidance on finding your server prefix.

## Set up your project

Once we have created our mailchimp account and obtained our KEYS, we need to defined them in our `.env` file

```bash
MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=
MAILCHIMP_AUDIENCE_ID=
MAILCHIMP_API_SERVER=
```

Install the mailchimp marketing dependency:

```bash
pnpm i @mailchimp/mailchimp_marketing
pnpm i --save-dev @types/mailchimp__mailchimp_marketing
```

## Creating our subscribe route

To handle the subscription request we will need to create a new API endpoint at `/pages/api/v1/newsletter/subscribe.ts`

```typescript
import mailchimp, { ErrorResponse } from "@mailchimp/mailchimp_marketing";
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";

export default async function handler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  if (req.method !== "POST") {
    return res
      .status(405)
      .json({ error: "METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED", message: "Method not allowed" });
  }

  const { email } = req.body;

  // Initialize the Mailchimp client

  mailchimp.setConfig({
    apiKey: process.env.MAILCHIMP_API_KEY,
    server: process.env.MAILCHIMP_API_SERVER,
  });

  try {
    const addNew = await mailchimp.lists.addListMember(
      String(process.env.MAILCHIMP_AUDIENCE_ID),
      {
        email_address: email,
        status: "subscribed",
      }
    );

    return res.status(200).json({ message: "Successfully subscribed email." });
  } catch (error: any) {
    if (
      error.response?.status === 400 &&
      error.response?.text?.includes("Member Exists")
    ) {
      return res
        .status(400)
        .json({ error: "ALREADY_SUBSCRIBED", message: "Already subscribed" });
    }

    console.error("Error subscribing email:", error);
    return res.status(500).json({
      error: "Failed to subscribe.",
      message: "Something went wrong, please try again later.",
    });
  }
}
```

## Designing the Newsletter Form

Well, once we have made our API endpoint we will need to show the form to the user.
Here I made a basic form that makes the request using `fetch` to our API endpoint and validates
if there is any error then show to the user.

Here is the code:

```js
"use client";
import { useState } from "react";

const NewsletterForm = () => {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
  const [isSubscribed, setIsSubscribed] = useState(false);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState("");

  const handleSubmit = async (e: any) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    if (email.trim() === "") {
      setError("Please enter a valid email");
      return;
    }

    setLoading(true);

    try {
      const response = await fetch("/api/v1/newsletter/subscribe", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ email }),
      });

      if (response.ok) {
        setIsSubscribed(true);
        setEmail("");
        setError("");
      } else {
        const errorData = await response.json();
        setError(
          errorData.message || "Failed to subscribe. Please try again later."
        );
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error subscribing to the newsletter:", error);
      setError("Failed to subscribe. Please try again later.");
    }

    setLoading(false);
  };

  return (
    <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 shadow-lg p-6 rounded-md gap-2 flex flex-col">
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200 mb-4">
        Subscribe to Our Newsletter
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
        Stay updated with the latest news, articles, and promotions.(Coming
        soon)
      </p>
      {error && <p className="text-red-500 mt-2">{error}</p>}
      {isSubscribed && (
        <p className="text-green-500 mt-2">
          Successfully subscribed to the newsletter!
        </p>
      )}
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className="flex flex-col">
        <input
          type="email"
          placeholder="Your Email"
          value={email}
          onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
          className="border disabled:cursor-not-allowed disabled:opacity-50 border-gray-300 bg:gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 rounded-md py-2 px-4 mb-4 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 dark:focus:ring-blue-300"
          disabled={loading}
        />

        <button
          type="submit"
          className="bg-blue-500 disabled:cursor-not-allowed disabled:opacity-50 dark:bg-blue-800 text-white font-medium py-2 px-4 rounded-md hover:bg-blue-600 dark:hover:bg-blue-700 transition-colors duration-300"
          disabled={loading}
        >
          {loading ? "Subscribing..." : "Subscribe"}
        </button>
      </form>

      <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">
        We respect your privacy and won&apos;t share your email address.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default NewsletterCard;
```

It displays error messages if there are any issues with the subscription process and shows a success message when the subscription is successful.
Feel free to customize the styles and add any additional functionality to meet your specific requirements.
